# 06.C_Sharp-OOP_I
I will be submitting exersices from the fifth course, that I am undergoing at the Software University(SoftUni) in Sofia, from 22.01.18 till 18.03.18. In the first part of the course we will learn how to work with different data structures - stacks, queues, matrices and jagged arrays. The second part of the course will teach us basic Object-Oriented Programming principles - objects, classes, attributes,(as well as:) encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism. This is my third professional course at SoftUni, part of the C# Fundamentals Module. I will be using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 for the upcomming tasks.
